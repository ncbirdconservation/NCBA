Confirmed,NY,Nest with Young,Nest with young seen or heard.
Confirmed,NE,Nest with Eggs,Nest with eggs.
Confirmed,FS,Carrying Fecal Sac,Adult carrying fecal sac.
Confirmed,FY,Feeding Young,"Adult feeding young that have left the nest, but are not yet flying and independent, for some projects should not be used with raptors, terns, and other species that may move many miles from the nest site; often supersedes FL)."
Confirmed,CF,Carrying Food,"Adult carrying food for young, for some projects should not be used for corvids, raptors, terns, and certain other species that regularly carry food for courtship or other purposes)."
Confirmed,FL,Recently Fledged Young,Recently fledged or downy young observed while still dependent upon adults.
Confirmed,ON,Occupied Nest,"Occupied nest presumed by parent entering and remaining, exchanging incubation duties, etc. (enter 0 if no birds seen)"
Confirmed,UN,Used Nest,"Nest is present, but not active. Use only if you are certain of the species that built the nest."
Confirmed,DD,Distraction Display,"Distraction display, including feigning injury."
Confirmed/Probable,NB,Nest Building,"Nest building at apparent nest site, should not be used for certain wrens, and other species that build dummy nests; see code B below for these species)."
Confirmed/Probable,CN,Carrying Nesting Material,Adult carrying nesting material; nest site not seen.
Probable,PE,Physiological Evidence,"Physiological evidence of nesting, usually a brood patch. This will be used only very rarely."
Probable,B,Wren/Woodpecker Nest Building,"Some species, including certain wrens, e.g., Marsh Wren), woodpeckers, and certain other cavity nesters, e.g., barbets) may build dummy nests and thus nest building activity cannot be considered confirmation. Use this category in those cases."
Probable,A,Agitated Behavior,"Agitated behavior or anxiety calls from an adult. This excludes responses elicited by pishing, playing recordings, or mobbing behavior that species engage in year-round, for instance, mobbing an owl)."
Probable,N,Visiting Probable Nest Site,"Visiting repeatedly probable nest site, primarily hole nesters)."
Probable,C,"Courtship, Display or Copulation","Courtship or copulation observed, including displays and courtship feeding."
Probable,T,Territorial Defense,Permanent territory presumed through defense of breeding territory by fighting or chasing individuals of same species.
Probable,P,Pair in Suitable Habitat,"Pair observed in suitable breeding habitat, for some projects only during breeding season)."
Probable,M,Multiple (7+) Singing Birds,"At least 7 singing birds present in suitable nesting habitat, for some projects only during breeding season)."
Probable,S7,Singing Bird Present 7+ Days,"Use only if you have observed a singing bird at the same spot, not elsewhere) one week or more earlier in the season. "
Possible,S,Singing Bird,"Singing bird present in suitable nesting habitat, for some projects only during  breeding season)."
Possible,H,In Appropriate Habitat,Adult in suitable nesting habitat during its breeding season.
Observed,F,Flyover,"Flying over only -- Use it only when all individuals are seen as flyovers; do not use it if just one bird stops or is located feeding on the ground or in vegetation. Raptors, swallows, and swifts that are flying overhead and not obvious migrants are not flyovers, since these birds are often using the habitat in ways not obvious to observers on the ground. This restriction depends upon the judgment of the observer, so when in doubt, do not use this code."
