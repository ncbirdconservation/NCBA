Function name	Short description
auk::auk_unique	Removes duplicates records from group checklists.
blocks_needed	Returns a data frame of blocks with geometries where the species was predicted to occur but has not been observed.
blocks_observed_in	Returns a data frame of blocks where the species was observed.
block_predicted_spp	Returns predicted summer and winter species lists.
block_spp_lists	Generates a list of species lists by breeding category for a specified block.
breeding_boxplot	Produces a boxplot of breeding codes over calendar day.
breeding_codes	Returns either a full or nested list of all breeding codes.
calculate_breeding_dates	Calculates start and end day of year for breeding in North Carolina.
complete_checklist_table	Returns a summary table of completeness (all species counted).
connect_ncba_db	Connects to the NCBA MongoDB database (AtlasCache).
counties_NC	Reads in a counties data frame with spatial attributes.
duration_distance_table	Returns a summary table of checklist duration and distance.
duration_minutes_boxplot	Describe the distribution of effort_minutes values as a box plot.
EBD_fields	Returns a list of fields present in an EBD download.
effort_distance_boxplot	Describes the distribution of effort_distance_km values as a boxplot.
get_blocks	Returns a data frame of blocks with or without geometries.
get_breeding_dates	Gets the start and end day of year for breeding from the Atlas Cache.  Species specific.
get_checklists	Get a data frame of checklists from the AtlasCache or an eBird data download.
	
get_observations	Returns a data frame of species observations.
get_predicted_presence	Returns a data frame of blocks where the species was predicted to occur.
highest_category	Returns a data frame of the highest breeding code reported in each block with geometries.
locality_type_pie	"Describe the locality types present as a pie chart: whether checklists are for hotspots, personal locations, etc."
map_needed_highest	Returns a ggplot2 map of where breeding observations are needed and the highest reported breeding category. 
nonEBD_fields	Returns a list of NCBA only fields that are in the Atlas Cache EBD collection.
observer_complete_by_priority	Returns a data frame summarizing an observers effort by checklist completeness and block type.  Reported values can be number of checklists or number of blocks.
observer_priority_by_breeding	Returns a table with species or block tallies by block type and breeding  category.
protocol_table	Returns a summary table of protocol type values from a data frame.
protocol_type_pie	"Describe the protocol types present as a pie chart: whether checklists are traveling, stationary, etc."
records_as_sf	Create new simple features collection (spatial data frame) of records (checklists or observations).  Output can be plotted or used as input for other functions.
spp_count_summary	Returns a table summarizing species count by breeding category.
start_time_boxplot	Describe the distribution of checklist start times as a box plot.
summarize_duration	Returns a data frame that summarizes hours of effort within a block.
to_EBD_format	Reformat columns to match that of the EBD.
year_bar	Summarize how many checklists were reported each year.
