Running the following lines of code will load the NCBA functions and connect to a table in the Atlas Cache
```{r}
# Set working directory to your code repo so that ncba functions can be loaded.
setwd("~/Code/NCBA/resources")

# Load the NCBA functions
source("ncba_functions.R")

# connect to a specific collection (table)
connection <- connect_ncba_db(ncba_config = config, database = "ebd_mgmt", 
                              collection = "ebd")
```

Here is the same code without any comments
```{r}
setwd("~/Code/NCBA/resources")
source("ncba_functions.R")
connection <- connect_ncba_db(ncba_config = config, database = "ebd_mgmt", 
                              collection = "ebd")
```
