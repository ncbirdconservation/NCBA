Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome from the community. Questions can be asked on the
[issues page][1]. Before creating a new issue, please take a moment to search
and make sure a similar issue does not already exist. If one does exist, you
can comment (most simply even with just a `:+1:`) to show your support for that
issue.

This project is currently following a [git feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).  If you would like to contribute, clone this repository to your workstation and create a branch for feature development that you work on.  The master branch must remain functional and only contain tested/reviewed code.  After you make edits to your feature branch, push it to [the main repo][1] and submit a pull request to merge it with the master branch.

At this time, the greatest contribution you can make is to install and
give feedback to the maintainer.

Task Management
==================

Individual tasks should be identified and described as individual issues so that they can be monitored and organized easily via the [github project](https://github.com/nmtarr/NCBA/projects/1).  Avoid grouping multiple tasks into a single issue unless they are closely related.  Detailed elaboration and discussion of issues is encouraged.  

Once created, tasks (issues) can be labeled as "wish", "to do", "in progress", or "done" in the NCBA Code Development project or another project.  Tasks should also be either claimed or assigned to an individual once they reach the "to do" phase.
