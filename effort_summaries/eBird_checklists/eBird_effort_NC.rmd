# Purpose
This notebook summarizes eBird sampling (effort) within North Carolina for the past 5 years.  Sampling data can be downloaded from the eBird website and queried with eBird's R package named "auk".  The script named "filter_eBird_sampling.R", which is saved in the NCBA github repo, performs the filtering that supports this notebook.  The notebook can be updated and revised periodically.

The records available from the sampling data set are for individual, unique checklists and several attributes are included for each.  This notebook summarizes the available attribute values to learn as much as possible about the recent eBird effort to date within North Carolina.  The available checklist attributes are:

checklist_id, last_edited_date, county, county_code, iba_code, bcr_code, 
usfws_code, atlas_block, locality, locality_id, locality_type, latitude,
longitude, observation_date, time_observations_started, observer_id, 
sampling_event_identifier, protocol_type, protocol_code, project_code, 
duration_minutes, effort_distance_km, effort_area_ha, number_observers,
all_species_reported, group_identifier, trip_comments

# General

* There are currently `r comma(length(unique(checklists$checklist_id)))` checklists from North Carolina in eBird.

# Week
```{r}

# Locality
```{r group_by_locality}
by_locality <- checklists %>%
  group_by(locality, locality_id) %>%

```

* Many checklists are revisits to previously surveyed locations.  The ratio of locations that were visited once to the total number of checklists is `r round(nrow(filter(by_locality, count==1))  / length(unique(checklists$checklist_id)), digits=2)`.

* Most locations have only been sampled once.  However, some locations have been visited a large number of times.

```{r per_county_bwplot}

       caption="Checklists from before 2021 are not included") +
  ylab("Checklists (n)") + 
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks=12)
```

Between `r comma(summary(by_county$count)[[1]])` and `r comma(summary(by_county$count)[[6]])` checklists are available for counties in North Carolina, and the median number of checklists is `r comma(summary(by_county$count)[[3]])`.

```{r per_county_map}
# Join to get the checklist count
counties.checklists <- counties %>%
  left_join(by_county, by = "county")

# Pull out just the column of interest here ("count") and plot it.
county.count <- select(counties.checklists, count, geom)
ggplot(data=county.count) +
  geom_sf(data=counties.checklists, aes(fill=count)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(trans = "sqrt", alpha = 1, option="E") +

```

### Top 10 Counties
```{r top_county_table}
knitr::kable(head(arrange(by_county, desc(count)), n=10), caption="Top 10 Counties")
```

```{r top_county_map}
# Add a column to record whether it's a "top" or "bottom" county as far as count goes.
tops <- counties.checklists %>% arrange(desc(count)) %>% head(n=10)
bottoms <- counties.checklists %>% arrange(count) %>% head(n=10)
counties.checklists <- counties.checklists %>%
  mutate(top10 = ifelse(count %in% tops$count, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(bottom10 = ifelse(count %in% bottoms$count, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# Pull out just the column of interest here ("count") and plot it.

  labs(title="Counties with large cities are heavily sampled",
       caption="Checklists from before 2021 are not included")
```

### Bottom 10 Counties
```{r bottom_county_table}
knitr::kable(head(arrange(by_county, count), n=10), caption="Bottom 10")
```

```{r bottom_county_map}
# Pull out just the column of interest here ("count") and plot it.

  labs(title="Counties with fewest checklists are in the NE Coastal Plains and piedmont",
       caption="Checklists from before 2021 are not included")
```

### Checklists per County Table
Note, the assignment of checklists to counties was performed by eBird and it is possible that errors exist due to traveling counts that cross county lines and errors in the recorded locations of checklists.
```{r per_county_all}
knitr::kable(by_county, caption="")
rm(by_county, tops, bottoms, tops2, bottoms2)
```

## Checklists per Atlas Block
Although coordinates are provided by eBird for checklists, they do not provide precise locations of eBirder effort for two reasons.  First, there are limits to the spatial precision of the points due to gps precision and/or observers ability to identify exactly where they birded on a map or in the app.  Second, many birders travel while birding but their paths are not available, only the distances they traveled.

Locational uncertainty is important and problematic because if it is large in relation to the level of analysis, it creates uncertainty about which spatial subregions, such as counties or atlas blocks, a checklist should be attributed to.  I explored two appraoches to handling locational uncertainty.

Method A -- Assign each checklist to the subregion that the checklist coordinate is located within.  This approach could generate deceptive results if checklists represent birding effort from multiple blocks but are assigned to a single block or if the coordinate is located in a block adjacent to where the birding actually occurred.  This approach should generally be expected to underestimate how many checklists covered some portion of a given block.

Method B -- Use polygons instead of the coordinates (points, Method A) in order to include the locational uncertainty.  Under this approach, coordinates are buffered with the distance traveled by the observer during the checklist period, plus 100 m to account for the fact that observers may have recorded birds at a distance from where they were located.  Each checklist is then assigned to all of the blocks that the polygon intersects in order to acknowledge that the checklist could represent effort from multiple blocks. Results from this approach can logically be expected to exaggerate the true footprint of birding effort and suggest blocks were sampled that actually were not, thus overestimating how many checklists covered some portion of a given block.  Furthermore, checklists with large effort distances produce enormous footprints than make results unhelpful.  Thus, I excluded checklists with effort distances greater than 5 km for this method.
```{r method_A}

Note: checklist footprints with center coordinates within select blocks are included in the map in order to display a sample of the underlying data for method B.  Priority centroids identify priority atlas blocks.

# Observers
## All observers
```{r observer_summary_stats}
by_observer <- checklists %>%
  group_by(observer_id) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n())
obs_summary <- by_observer$count %>%
  summary()
```

Most eBirders have only submitted a handful of checklists. The median number of checklists submitted is only `r obs_summary[[3]]`, and observers who have submitted more than `r obs_summary[[5]]` are in the top quartile for number of submissions.
```{r observer_boxplot}
ggplot(data=by_observer) +

## Core observers
It is informative to look more closely at a subset of active observers in order to better characterize observers who may participate in the atlas.  Here, I exclude the extreme outliers and people with fewer than some arbitrarily "small" number of submissions (20). 
```{r core_observer_stats}

```

* The durations of most checklists are less than one day (1,440 minutes), but `r nrow(too_long)` checklists carried on longer than a day and `r nrow(sorta_long)` checklists lasted between 12 and 24 hours. 
* I omitted checklists longer than 12 hours for the summaries in this section.
